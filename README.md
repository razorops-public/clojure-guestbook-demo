## Razorops CI/CD pipeline demo of guestbook application in Clojure

If you have forked this repo, then connect with Razorops to create your demo pipeline by following the below button

[![Connect](https://github.com/razorops-public/images/blob/main/connect_with_github.svg)](https://dashboard.razorops.com/get-github-installation-link-for-org)

This is an example code to demonstrate how to create [Clojure](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) based pipeline on [Razorops](https://docs.razorops.com/) CI/CD platform.

It's a guestbook app generated using [Luminus](https://luminusweb.com/) (version "3.93") web framework in Clojure. It allows users to leave a message and to view a list of messages left by others.

The code is inspired from example source code from [official tutorial](https://luminusweb.com/docs/guestbook).
